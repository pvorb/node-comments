# Comments

**Commments** is an abstraction layer for MongoDB that allows for easily
providing some commenting functionality.

## Usage

```javascript
new Comments(options)
```

Creates a new Comments object. This means, a connection to MongoDB is set up.

*   `options` is an object that defines some DB connection parameters.

    The default options are as follows:

    ```javascript
    {
      host: 'localhost',      // - hostname of the server where mongodb is
                              //   running
      port: 27017,            // - port that is used by mongodb
      name: 'website',        // - name of the mongodb database
      collection: 'comments', // - name of the collection that contains the
                              //   comments
      index: 'doc'            // - fields to be indexed
    }
    ```

    For more information on how to define `opt.index` look at
    [the MongoDB documentation][mongodb-doc-indexes].

```javascript
comments.saveComment(comment, saved)
```

Adds a new or updates a comment in the collection depending on if there already
is a comment with the same `_id` property. If `comment` does not define an
`_id` property, a new comment is created.

*   `comment` is an object that defines a comment. It is stored directly into
    the collection. Any prior parsing is up to you. `comment.doc` should be
    defined for the later use of `comments.getComments`.
*   `saved` is a callback function that takes two arguments `(error, comment)`.
    `error` is an `Error` object, when an error occurred, otherwise it is
    `null`. `comment` is either the saved comment object or `1` if an existing
    comment has been updated.

---

```javascript
comments.getComments(doc, [[properties,] options,] received)
```

Gives access to the comments of a document.

*   `doc` is a string defining the document that contains the comments that you
    are looking for. If `doc` is `null`, all comments in the collection will be
    found.
*   `properties [optional]` is an object that defines, which properties of the
    comments shall be returned.

    The default properties are as follows:

    ```javascript
    {
      _id: true,
      author: true,
      website: true,
      created: true,
      message: true
    }
    ```
*   `options [optional]` is an object that defines additional options according
    to [section "Query options"][mongodb-doc-queries] like _sorting_ or
    _paging_.

    The default options are as follows:

    ```javascript
    {
      sort: "created" // sort results by date of creation in ascending order
    }
    ```
*   `received` is a callback function that takes two arguments
    `(error, results)`. `error` is an `Error` object, when an error occurred,
    otherwise it is `null`. `results` is a cursor to the result set of the
    query. Look at [section "Cursors"][mongodb-doc-queries] for more
    information on how to use them.

---

```javascript
comments.count(doc, counted)
```

Counts the comments of a document or the complete collection.

*   `doc` is a string defining the document that contains the comments that you
    are looking for. If `doc` is `null`, all comments in the collection will be
    counted.
*   `counted` is a callback function that takes two arguments `(error, count)`.
    `error` is an `Error` object, when an error occurred, otherwise it is
    `null`. `count` is the number of comments for the document or in the
    collection.

## Installation

You need a running MongoDB before you can use **Comments**. On Debian

```bash
# apt-get install mongodb
```

Then install **Comments** with npm.

```bash
# npm install -g Comments
```
